#![## Idio Web Server] Idio Web Server

Idio is a professional web server based on Koa compiled with Closure Compiler down to 2 dependencies. It is created by Art Decoâ„¢, a <a href="https://www.artd.eco">Node.JS development company in London</a> to enable rapid web development process with maximum efficiency. It has all middleware necessary to make modern full-stack services, including back-end routes and front-end components.

Check out <a href="https://github.com/idiocc/idio">GitHub</a> README and <a href="https://github.com/idiocc/idio/wiki">Wiki</a> for more information.

A bare Koa server consists of 43 dependencies, and when installing all middleware required for an essential web server, this number can go up to 150 and higher. We've completely rewritten Koa, its components and middleware into ES6 to produce Idio &mdash; a state of art webserver, type-checked and optimised with Closure Compiler. We left only 2 dependencies: `mime-db` and `text-decoding` that contain databases of mime types and encoding tables. This means that the installation time is minimal, and there's absolutely no rubbish in your `node_modules` directory.
