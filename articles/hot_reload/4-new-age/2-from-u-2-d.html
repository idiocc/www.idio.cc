###! From User To Developer

However, now we can explore another way: in 2020, we're moving on to new age tools that provide completely transparent experience, thanks to the adoption of modules by browsers. They will allow you to stop being a USER of 3rd party technology, and remain a DEVELOPER who takes her profession in hand.

Today, web developers can finally focus on utilising language and worry less about bundling. We still need to build for older browsers which is fine, but development process can go directly through  the browser, bypassing custom modular systems of build tools that were required before browsers supported modules. This is how nice and important ES6 is, benefits of which we are ripping today.

<!-- Most of the build pipelines are based on Webpack, _Rollup_ and Babel. And to tell you the truth: Open Source vendor lock is even worse than corporate one, because those who run such popular Open Source projects don't accept any criticism as they think that because they are volunteers, you don't have any rights as a user. -->

</p> -->

<!-- You're now vendor locked, AND you can't ever express your dissatisfaction with something. And actually why do we have to use software like Babel and Webpack &mdash; because it's good, or because we had no choice?  -->

<!-- so that you can expect to be a VALUED and LOVED user, and not hostage to somebody's technology. -->

<!-- because it's popular Open Source developers of those projects who now think they're the rules of the world with all that popularity hitting their heads, while you're not allowed to raise any complaints about their software, because they're apparently volunteers providing software to you for free. -->

<!-- It's true that Webpack as a build tool was needed during the last 5 years. It has got nice features like code splitting. But the room for dev utils that take advantage of present-day opportunities is being filled by more nimble software.  -->

Although we've been talking about build tools up to this point, I'd like you to switch off thinking in terms of the platform they provide from now on: with _new age_ in mind, we always focus on the *principle* and not technology.
