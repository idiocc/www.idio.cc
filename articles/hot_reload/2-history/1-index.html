##! History of HMR

I'm not going to go into much detail since I'm not really interested in the past, but prefer to look into the future instead. I came to know Hot Module Reload like any React developer from documentation in 2017, which by then was pretty stable. But the concept of hot module reload was first discussed by [Bruce Hauman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-kj2qwJa_E) and [Dan Abramov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs) back in 2015. At the time, it was a pretty ground-breaking concept, welcomed with enthusiasm by many developers as it's really an essential feature of a development environment since it preserves your creativity flow.

Dan's idea is to use a Babel transform to update code at run-time in such a way as to record methods of a class separately and replace them in instances with proxies. When a change is detected, new methods are sent to the client, and proxies will now execute new code, therefore the actual instance and its state stay untouched. It's about wrapping methods and functions with another meta-function that would be able to perform substitutions at runtime. The transform is what makes up [`react-hot-loader`](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/) while it's _Webpack_ that is responsible for establishing client-server communication and providing an API for updates.

Now I don't really know how Webpack does what it does, but as far as I can remember, it kind of implements its own modular system by analysing source code and building dependency trees, so that it can also tree-shake unused code. It will always wrap source code into its own, making it a black box for everyone who doesn't get hands on its internals. Webpack has become pretty much a standard for front-end web-development, but did you know that you're pulling 342 additional dependencies with it during installation:

This is absolute madness. This is what I hate about modern Node.JS state-of-art, it's completely bonkers. Say you want to create a very simple JS app, but to get started, you basically need a nuclear power plant in EACH of your projects! It's not acceptable and all these dependencies would repulse any sane developer, had the community not been beaten into submission by pseudo industry leaders, and developers have nothing left but to quietly obey and keep installing _Webpacks_ and _Babels_. *Idio* is finally here to fix this and put open source right. I'm going to liberate you from this hell.
