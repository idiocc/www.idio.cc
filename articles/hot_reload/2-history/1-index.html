##! HMR 101

JQuery first appeared in 2006, and JavaScript for the web was quite common of course. But it was in 2012-2015 that the web really underwent its industrial revolution: Flash was being abandoned, multiple Open Source UI frameworks such as React and Vue emerged and started to gain popularity, and build tools began to fill their market niche. It was also time for the hot reload to appear.

###! React Hot Reload

<!-- I'm not going to go into much detail since I'm not really interested in the past, but prefer to look into the future instead.  -->

I came to know Hot Module Reload like any React developer from documentation in 2017, which by then was pretty stable. But the concept of hot module reload was first discussed by [Bruce Hauman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-kj2qwJa_E) and [Dan Abramov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs) back in 2015. At the time, it was a pretty ground-breaking idea, welcomed with enthusiasm by many developers as it's really an essential feature of a development environment that preserves your creativity flow.

Dan's solution is to record methods of a class separately and replace them in instances with proxies. When a change is detected, new methods are sent to the client, and proxies will now execute new code, therefore the actual instance and its state stay untouched. It's about wrapping methods and functions with another meta-function that would be able to perform substitutions at runtime.

To enable the reload for React, we need to import the ``hot`` method and wrap the default method with it:

```js
import { Component } from 'react'
import { hot } from 'react-hot-loader'

class App extends Component {
  render() {}
}

export default hot(module)(App)
```

When calling the ``hot`` method for the first time, its code will register a proxy for the class.

<highlightjs src="../example/wrapper.mjs" />

A proxy means that methods of the prototype were wrapped by a function that can will call updated methods when they arrive. This is why when you step into an method of a class when hot reload is activated, you'll not get to it straight away, but will end up in the `wrappedMethod` instead as shown on the video below.

The wrapper and other features make up [`react-hot-loader`](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/) while it's _Webpack_ that is responsible for establishing client-server communication and providing an API for updates of MODULES (everything that's exported), but not classes (refreshes to which are more refined by React's hot loader).
