###! Exploiting Bindings

When creating proxies, we took notice of the fact that whatever we export originally is prevalent through the rest of the code. It's the same as with bindings, whatever we export first, is always referenced in all places it was imported, even if we change its value. Therefore, proxies themselves are just kind of bindings, which means we can eliminate them! You can get the idea of where I'm going with this.
