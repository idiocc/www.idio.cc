###! Bindings Intro

To dig deeper, we need to understand the essential property of ES6 modules. It is that we always export a binding and not the actual object or primitive value. It's quite different from traditional CommonJS modules, such that are used in Node.JS. Consider the illustration below:

```js
// lib.js
export let a = 10
export const changeA = () => {
  a = a + 1
}
```

Here, we export 2 BINDINGS from the lib file: a binding of the variable ``a``, and a binding of variable ``changeA``. In case of `changeA`, the binding is constant which means that this variable can't bind to anything else other than it's original assignment (or slot in memory in other words).

```js
// index.js
import { a, changeA } from './lib.js'

console.log(a) // 10
changeA()
console.log(a) // 11
```

When we import those BINDINGS and execute the `changeA` function, despite the fact that the value of `a` is primitive, it's changed to 11, because in the original file we updated the value of the binding. But this only works because we declared `a` as a ``let``. As you know, we can't assign over consts:

```js
// lib.js
export const a = 10
export const changeA = () => {
  a = a + 1
  // a++ is also illegal
}
```

If we change the binding to be *const*ant like above, we won't be able to make changes to it.

```js
// index.js
import { a, changeA } from './lib.js'

console.log(a) // 10
changeA() // throws: Assignment to constant variable.
```

This is a very short intro, but just for the sake of completeness, you obviously can exports objects and then reassign to their properties. It's common sense.

```js
export const a = {}
export const changeA = () => {
  a.b = 'hello world'
}
```

How does this help us with hot reload?
