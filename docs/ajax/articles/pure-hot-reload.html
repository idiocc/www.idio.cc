Additionally, when the code is updated, the developer needs to refresh the page which takes a little bit of time. Although this time span can be pretty short (e.g., 1-2 seconds), if the process is repeated over and over again, it adds up to hours in total by the end of the work week (e.g., 2s per refresh &#215; 50  refreshes per hour &#215; 8 hours a day &#215; 5 days = 4000s = 66 min = ~1 hour). It's much better to free up this time and use it more productively, for example, to add a few extra tests or examples in documentation.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <img class=\"ImageHolder b-vk b-t\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 991.8px) 540px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 720px,855px\" alt=\"hot reload in javascript\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='2816' height='1880'/%3E\">\n  <noscript>\n    <picture>\n      <source\n        srcset=\"hot_reload/img/hot-reload-splash-1140.webp 1140w,hot_reload/img/hot-reload-splash-768.webp 768w,hot_reload/img/hot-reload-splash-576.webp 576w,hot_reload/img/hot-reload-splash-319.webp 319w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 991.8px) 540px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 720px,855px\"\n        type=\"image/webp\">\n      <img class=\"b-vk b-t\" onLoad=\"webploaded(this)\" alt=\"hot reload in javascript\" src=\"hot_reload/img/hot-reload-splash-1140.jpg\" srcset=\"hot_reload/img/hot-reload-splash-1140.jpg 1140w,hot_reload/img/hot-reload-splash-768.jpg 768w,hot_reload/img/hot-reload-splash-576.jpg 576w,hot_reload/img/hot-reload-splash-319.jpg 319w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 991.8px) 540px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 720px,855px\">\n    </picture>\n  </noscript>\n</p>\n\n<p>This is why the concept of <strong>hot reload</strong> was invented: to watch changes in the source code, and send the browser a message, that an update is needed. But HR is more than that: it's not just about reloading the window, it's about substituting existing code (functions, classes), for new one SEAMLESSLY for maximum productivity and efficiency. This is not just a \"nice\" feature to have, it's a functional requirement for <em>Preact</em> and <em>React</em> components that can have a STATE: if we just refreshed a component, the state will be lost and we'd have to restart our testing process from the beginning (e.g., select destination from the list, then select a car, to get to the state when the \"continue\" button is showing). Hot reload allows to preserve components' state and helps us develop applications quickly.</p>\n\n<p><em>Idio</em> web server belongs to a new generation of tooling that take the maximum advantage of language features. ES6 standard has been completed in 2015, and everything that we need for web development is available to us already without any need to transpile language features, making such tools as <em>Webpack</em> and <em>Babel</em> redundant for development. And for the build step, our <a href=\"https://www.artd.eco\">Node.JS development company</a> is using <em>Closure Compiler</em>. The requirements are thus to transpile JSX, serve packages as modules, and enable hot reload. All of these features are provided by <em>Idio</em> that aims to implement effective solutions using bare minimum of additional code, and just let browsers do the work. In this article, I'll explain, how <strong>pure</strong> hot reload can work, that is, using JavaScript itself instead of getting vendor-locked into complex packages like <em>Webpack</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"SectionBreak\">\n  <a title=\"Back To Top\" href=\"#top\">\n    <img alt=\"section break\"\n      src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='40' height='15'/%3E\" data-io>\n    <noscript><img alt=\"section break\" src=\"/section-breaks/0.svg\"></noscript></a>\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div data-section id=\"hmr-101\">\n<h2>HMR 101</h2>\n\n<!-- I'm not going to go into much detail since I'm not really interested in the past, but prefer to look into the future instead.  -->\n\n<p>I came to know Hot Module Reload like any <em>React</em> developer from documentation in 2017, which by then was pretty stable. But the concept of hot module reload was first discussed by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-kj2qwJa_E\">Bruce Hauman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs\">Dan Abramov</a> back in 2015. At the time, it was a pretty ground-breaking idea, welcomed with enthusiasm by many developers as it's really an essential feature of a development environment that preserves your creativity flow.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <div style=\"position:relative;\" id=\"c3492\">\n    <img class=\"ImageHolder b-t\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 991.8px) 540px,652px\" alt=\"dan abramov talk\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='652' height='362'/%3E\">\n    <noscript>\n      <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"hot_reload/img/dan-576.webp 576w,hot_reload/img/dan-319.webp 319w,hot_reload/img/dan-652.webp 652w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 991.8px) 540px,652px\" type=\"image/webp\">\n        <img class=\"b-t\" onLoad=\"webploaded(this)\" alt=\"dan abramov talk\" src=\"hot_reload/img/dan-576.jpg\" srcset=\"hot_reload/img/dan-576.jpg 576w,hot_reload/img/dan-319.jpg 319w,hot_reload/img/dan-652.jpg 652w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 991.8px) 540px,652px\">\n      </picture>\n    </noscript>\n  </div>\n</p>\n\n<p>Dan's solution is to record methods of a class separately and replace them in instances with proxies. When a change is detected, new methods are sent to the client, and proxies will now execute new code, therefore the actual instance and its state stay untouched. It's about wrapping methods and functions with another meta-function that would be able to perform substitutions at runtime.</p>\n\n<p>To enable the reload for <em>React</em>, we need to import the <span class=\"tm2\">hot</span> method and wrap the default method with it:</p>\n\n<pre id=\"ccdbf\"><code class=\"javascript hljs\">import { Component } from 'react'\nimport { hot } from 'react-hot-loader'\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {}\n}\n\nexport default hot(module)(App)</code></pre>\n\n<p>When calling the <span class=\"tm2\">hot</span> method for the first time, its code will register a proxy for the class.</p>\n\n<pre id=\"ccdbf6\"><code class=\"javascript hljs\">// hot will call:\nreactHotLoader.register(\n  WrappedComponent,\n  getComponentDisplayName(WrappedComponent),\n  'RHL' + moduleId\n);\n\n// register =&gt; createClassProxy =&gt;\n// defineProxyMethods =&gt; fakeBasePrototype =&gt;\n\n/* Each method is going to be wrapped now */\nfunction methodWrapperFactory(wrapperName, realMethod) {\n  return copyMethodDescriptors(function wrappedMethod() {\n    for (var _len2 = arguments.length,\n      rest = Array(_len2),\n      _key2 = 0; _key2 &lt; _len2; _key2++\n    ) {\n      rest[_key2] = arguments[_key2];\n    }\n\n    return realMethod.apply(this, rest);\n  }, realMethod);\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>A proxy means that methods of the prototype were wrapped by a function that can will call updated methods when they arrive. This is why when you step into an method of a class when hot reload is activated, you'll not get to it straight away, but will end up in the <span class=\"tm\">wrappedMethod</span> instead as shown on the video below.</p>\n\n<div style=\"position:relative;\" id=\"c5c99\">\n  <img class=\"ImageHolder b-t b-vk b-bk b-xq\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 991.8px) 540px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 720px,855px\" alt=\"using the debugger\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='914' height='346'/%3E\">\n  <noscript>\n    <picture>\n      <source\n        srcset=\"hot_reload/2-history/img/devtools-768.webp 768w,hot_reload/2-history/img/devtools-576.webp 576w,hot_reload/2-history/img/devtools-319.webp 319w,hot_reload/2-history/img/devtools-914.webp 914w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 991.8px) 540px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 720px,855px\"\n        type=\"image/webp\">\n      <img class=\"b-t b-vk b-bk b-xq\" onLoad=\"webploaded(this)\" alt=\"using the debugger\" src=\"hot_reload/2-history/img/devtools-768.jpg\" srcset=\"hot_reload/2-history/img/devtools-768.jpg 768w,hot_reload/2-history/img/devtools-576.jpg 576w,hot_reload/2-history/img/devtools-319.jpg 319w,hot_reload/2-history/img/devtools-914.jpg 914w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 991.8px) 540px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 720px,855px\">\n    </picture>\n  </noscript>\n</div>\n\n<p>The wrapper and other features make up <a href=\"https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/\"><span class=\"tm\">react-hot-loader</span></a> while it's <em>Webpack</em> that is responsible for establishing client-server communication and providing an API for updates of MODULES (everything that's exported), but not classes (refreshes to which are more refined by <em>React</em>'s hot loader).</p>\n\n<div data-section id=\"webpack-modules\">\n<h3><em>Webpack</em> Modules</h3>\n\n<p>Whereas the <span class=\"tm\">react-hot-loader</span> can be seen as \"software\" reloading mechanism, the modular system of <em>Webpack</em> can then be thought of as underlying \"hardware\".

In short, it analyses source code, builds dependency trees, and puts everything together (it can also tree-shake unused code). It will always wrap source code into its own, making it a black box for everyone who doesn't get hands on its internals. The total code can then be served to the browser in chunks, but it's all tied up to <em>Webpack</em>'s own modules.</p>\n\n<pre id=\"ccdbf1\"><code class=\"javascript hljs\">/* index.js */\nconst a = lib()\n\n// becomes:\nconst a = Object(_lib__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_3__[\"lib\"])();\n\n/* lib.js */\nexport const lib = () =&gt; {\n  console.log('lib')\n}\n\n// becomes\n\"use strict\";\n__webpack_require__.r(__webpack_exports__);\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"lib\", function() { return lib; });\nconst lib = () =&gt; {\n  return 'example';\n};</code></pre>\n\n<p>Both files are concatenated into a single chunk. The code above shows that the lynchpin of <em>Webpack</em> is <span class=\"tm\">__webpack_require__</span> that ties together all modules in the whole of the bundle. It's quite similar to browserify that also makes use of CommonJS require method (via its <a href=\"https://github.com/browserify/browser-pack/blob/master/prelude.js\"><span class=\"tm2\">prelude</span></a>) to make dependencies aware of each other.</p>\n\n<p><em>Webpack</em> has become pretty much a default for front-end web-development, but did you know that the price for this complexity is 342 additional dependencies you're pulling along during its installation:</p>\n\n<p class=\"b-kC\">\n  <img class=\"b-vk b-t\" alt=\"webpack dependencies graph\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='864' height='484'/%3E\" data-io>\n  <noscript>\n    <img class=\"b-vk b-t\" alt=\"webpack dependencies graph\" src=\"hot_reload/img/webpack.jpg\">\n  </noscript>\n</p>\n\n<p>Your <span class=\"tm2\">node_modules</span> will be 20MB after that, but it seems like nobody cares about that sort of thing anymore. Everyone is so used to this sad reality of life, that it just became normal. <em>Webpack</em> is probably OK for larger projects but if you want to create a very simple JS app, you basically need a nuclear power plant, and this is repeated for each new project. <em>Webpack</em> is good software that has helped to put together many websites, but it doesn't have to be a standard. I'm not very happy with jamming my <span class=\"tm\">node_modules</span> so that I can produce a bundle.</p>\n\n<!-- This is absolute madness. This is what I hate about modern Node.JS state-of-art, it's completely bonkers. It's not acceptable and all these dependencies would repulse any sane developer, had the community not been beaten into submission by current industry leaders, and developers have nothing left but to quietly obey and keep installing <em>Webpacks</em> and <em>Babels</em>. <strong>Idio</strong> is finally here to fix this and put open source right.

Today web developers can finally focus on utilising language and worry less about bundling. We still need to build for older browsers which is fine, but development process can go directly through  the browser, bypassing custom modular systems of build tools that were required before browsers supported modules.

You specify the directory with your frontend code, e.g., <span class=\"tm\">frontend</span>.\n</h3>\n\n<p>For example, you can have the following source in <span class=\"tm2\">frontend/index.js</span>:</p>\n\n<pre id=\"ccdbf2\"><code class=\"javascript hljs\">import { dep } from 'my-dep'\nimport local from './local'\n\nconst el = document.querySelector('#id')\ndep(el) // execute dependency\nlocal(el) // execute local</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the browser requests this JS module via a script tag, <span class=\"tm\">&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot; src=&quot;frontend&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>, <strong>FrontEnd</strong> will intersect the request, and lookup <span class=\"tm\">my-dep</span> in your <span class=\"tm2\">node_modules</span>, to find its <em>package.json</em>. From there, the <strong>module</strong> field will be read, and the served file will actually contain absolute paths required by the browser. Local dependencies can also be served, which would be impossible under normal circumstances when the extension (<span class=\"tm\">.js</span>) is not present, but the middleware can handle that.</p>\n\n<pre id=\"ccdbf3\"><code class=\"javascript hljs\">import { dep } from '/node_modules/my-dep/src/index.js'\nimport local from './local'\n\nconst el = document.querySelector('#id')\ndep(el) // execute dependency\nlocal(el) // execute local</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now the browser can import the dependency natively. The middleware will return any JS file under the <span class=\"tm2\">/node_module</span> path, enabling direct dependency serving, without having to wrap anything in vendor modular system. This simple step drastically reduces the complexity of the tool-chain, as it's the browser that's doing most of the work from this point onwards. On-the-fly modifications of paths are made with the simplest RegEx that picks up <span class=\"tm\">import</span> statements.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"2-you-write-jsx-code-in-your-frontend\">2. You write JSX code in your frontend.</h3>\n\n<p>JSX is positively THE BEST templating syntax for web development, and there's no doubt about that. Although it was initially developed by <em>React</em>, its roots actually go much deeper than that, as MXML (Flash applications) used to have similar structure.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <img class=\"ImageHolder b-t\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 991.8px) 540px,576px\" alt=\"flex bindings\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='576' height='212'/%3E\">\n  <noscript>\n    <picture>\n      <source\n        srcset=\"hot_reload/img/binding-576.webp 576w,hot_reload/img/binding-319.webp 319w,hot_reload/img/binding-576.webp 576w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 991.8px) 540px,576px\" type=\"image/webp\">\n      <img class=\"b-t\" onLoad=\"webploaded(this)\" alt=\"flex bindings\" src=\"hot_reload/img/binding-576.jpg\" srcset=\"hot_reload/img/binding-576.jpg 576w,hot_reload/img/binding-319.jpg 319w,hot_reload/img/binding-576.jpg 576w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 991.8px) 540px,576px\">\n    </picture>\n  </noscript>\n  <br><span class=\"b-dC\"> &copy; <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/databinding_pitfalls.html\">Elad Elrom, Adobe</a> 2010</span>\n</p>\n\n<p>JSX is a revival of MXML and an essential part of programming of the web. There's an interesting alternative to JSX called <span class=\"tm\">lit-html</span> but it makes no sense why I should use template literals when writing tags. It's simply a hack to eliminate JSX transpilation, but it's not a replacement for JSX, which is the daddy of modern web computing.</p>\n\n<pre id=\"ccdbf7\"><code class=\"javascript hljs\">// JSX\nimport { render, Component } from 'preact'\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super()\n    this.state = { name: 'world' }\n  }\n  render({ message }) {\n    return (&lt;div&gt;\n      Hello, &lt;span&gt;{this.state.name}&lt;/span&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        {message}\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;)\n  }\n}\n\nrender(&lt;App message=\"Idio\"/&gt;, document.querySelector('.app'))</code></pre>\n\n<p>An example of using lit html is the following:</p>\n\n<pre id=\"ccdbf8\"><code class=\"javascript hljs\">import { define, html } from 'https://unpkg.com/hybrids@4.1.3/src/index.js'\n\nconst HybridsApp = {\n  appName: 'Welcome to Hybrids!',\n\n  pageLoaded: '&lt;span&gt;No page loaded, yet.&lt;/span&gt;',\n\n  page: ({ pageLoaded }) =&gt; pageLoaded,\n\n  render: ({ appName, page }) =&gt;\n    html`\n      &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;${appName}&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;Example of an unbundled Hybrids app with dynamic imports.&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;\n          &lt;button onclick=\"${load}\" page=\"./pages/Welcome.mjs\"&gt;\n            Welcome Page\n          &lt;/button&gt;\n          &lt;button onclick=\"${load}\" page=\"./pages/Other.mjs\"&gt;\n            Other Page\n          &lt;/button&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    `,\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p><span class=\"b-dC\">&copy; F1LT3R 2020, <a href=\"https://github.com/F1LT3R/hybrids-dynamic-load\"><span class=\"tm\">hybrids-dynamic-load</span></a>.</span></p>\n\n<p>The advantage of this over JSX is that it doesn't require transpilation and can be run natively within a browser. The disadvantage is that there's no syntax highlighting (unless you use a plugin) and it's not as fluent as JSX that doesn't require calling <span class=\"tm\">html</span> function to start a template block.</p>\n\n<p>You might be thinking that to transpile JSX you need <em>Babel</em>, but the fact is that you don't. You don't need to build ASTs and you don't need to install additional 250 dependencies that come with <em>Babel</em>, another \"established\" standard of coding. <strong>FrontEnd</strong> uses a <a href=\"https://github.com/a-la/jsx\">JSX transpiler</a> powered by regular expressions. It includes a hack to find where the initial tag (<span class=\"tm2\">&lt;</span>) is opening by evaluating the jsx file using the <span class=\"tm\">vm</span> module of Node.JS. The tag is detected by listening to an error:</p>\n\n<pre id=\"ccdbf4\"><code class=\"javascript hljs\">/Users/zavr/a-la/jsx/test/fixture/Component.jsx:2\n  &lt;div className={className}&gt;\n  ^\n\nSyntaxError: Unexpected token &lt;</code></pre>\n\n<p>This evaluation is needed to prevent false positives, e.g., <span class=\"tm\">if (a&lt;example &amp;&amp; b)</span>. After detecting the location of the angle bracket, we are able to parse text, until the closing tag is found, unless it was self-closing. Properties are also extracted using regular expressions on strings. Now look, you can think that it's very simplistic, but this stuff works and works really well. It supports comments and pretty much everything you want from JSX, except that you can't use <span class=\"tm\">&gt;</span> in properties, e.g.,</p>\n\n<pre id=\"ccdbf9\"><code class=\"javascript hljs\">const Next = () =&gt; (&lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Next Page&lt;/a&gt;)\n\nconst Component = ({ data = [] }) =&gt; {\n  return (&lt;div&gt; {\n    data.map((i, j) =&gt; {\n      if (j &gt; 10) return &lt;Next /&gt;\n      return i\n    })\n  }\n  &lt;/div&gt;)\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>But methods like that simply need to be taken out of the tag scope. You're probably not going to replace <em>Webpack</em> with <em>Idio</em> at your corporate insurer job, but if you're working for fun projects, there's no reason why you can't be using this. Except for that there's no source maps, which will be added later on this year, but because the code produced looks absolutely natural, it's easy to debug it anyway (unless you've got the super-power setup where your VS Code debugger hooks up to a running Chrome RDP process).</p>\n\n<pre id=\"ccdbf5\"><code class=\"javascript hljs\">// JSX - compiled code\nimport { render, Component } from 'preact'\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super()\n    this.state = { name: 'world' }\n  }\n  render({ message }) {\n    return (h('div',{},\n      `Hello, `,h('span',{},this.state.name),\n      h('p',{},\n        message,\n      ),\n    ))\n  }\n}\n\nrender(h(App,{message:\"Idio\"}), document.querySelector('.app'))</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've created many <a href=\"https://akashic.page\">widgets</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/art-deco/file-upload.artdeco.app\">front-end apps</a> and back-end servers with SSR powered by this transpiler. There hasn't been any problems. Maybe it will throw errors on some very advanced edge use cases (never happened for me, although your usage might be something I've never tested), but simplifying code will always help. Its simplicity is the key.</p>\n\n<div class=\"b-B b-Mk b-gm\">\n  <div class=\"b-xq b-yb b-Nb\">\n    <img class=\"ImageHolder b-vk b-t\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 991.8px) 510px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 330px,466px\" alt=\"control photo with birds\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='2816' height='1880'/%3E\">\n    <noscript>\n      <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"hot_reload/img/control-1140.webp 1140w,hot_reload/img/control-768.webp 768w,hot_reload/img/control-576.webp 576w,hot_reload/img/control-319.webp 319w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 991.8px) 510px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 330px,466px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\">\n        <img class=\"b-vk b-t\" onLoad=\"webploaded(this)\" alt=\"control photo with birds\" src=\"hot_reload/img/control-1140.jpg\" srcset=\"hot_reload/img/control-1140.jpg 1140w,hot_reload/img/control-768.jpg 768w,hot_reload/img/control-576.jpg 576w,hot_reload/img/control-319.jpg 319w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 991.8px) 510px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 330px,466px\">\n      </picture>\n    </noscript>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"b-yb b-Lb\">\n    <p>As an indie web developer, I was looking to fulfil the need to create JS applications for the web without anything getting in the way.

I'm not offering you an alternative that you'll be stuck with: you can see that developing front-end is really easy in 2020, as all you need is to serve JavaScript modules with a few on-the-fly modifications. I've not invented a new system, I've only patched up those things that were missing:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>rename imported package names into paths: <span class=\"tm2\">'dep'</span> -> <span class=\"tm\">'/node_modules/dep/src/module.js'</span>;</li>\n  <li>serve packages and other JS files even without extensions (<span class=\"tm\">'./lib'</span>);</li>\n  <li>transpile JSX on the fly via MVP transpiler;</li>\n  <li>[read below] implement hot reload for ES6 exports.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<!-- After being liberated from the shackles of dependencies, I could finally focus on writing source code to build more software products for my company.

If you think that you can just install a bunch of dependencies, and add a bit of code, you're making a script. The purpose of going to University to learn Computer Science, is to get trained as a scientist which isn't about programming at all. If you want to learn frameworks, don't bother with a degree. Making software and professional Software Engineering is pure science. The job of a scientist is a process:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Understand the problem at hand, do the research.</li>\n  <li>Come up with a hypothesis, i.e. how you're going to solve the problem, what results do you expect.</li>\n  <li>Prepare and conduct your experiments to get empirical data.</li>\n  <li>Evaluate the hypothesis against the results. If they don't match, report it to understand why and start over.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm going to show how I take scientific approach to solving problems. If Computer <strong>Science</strong> is a theoretical framework for your life (not just computation theory), Software <strong>Engineering</strong> is a practical application of this framework. Each step in the former corresponds to a step in the latter so let me draw parallels.</p>\n\n<p>\n  <img class=\"ImageHolder b-vk b-t\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 991.8px) 540px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 720px,855px\" alt=\"software engineering is science\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1500' height='1000'/%3E\">\n  <noscript>\n    <picture>\n      <source\n        srcset=\"hot_reload/img/science-1140.webp 1140w,hot_reload/img/science-768.webp 768w,hot_reload/img/science-576.webp 576w,hot_reload/img/science-319.webp 319w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 991.8px) 540px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 720px,855px\"\n        type=\"image/webp\">\n      <img class=\"b-vk b-t\" onLoad=\"webploaded(this)\" alt=\"software engineering is science\" src=\"hot_reload/img/science-1140.jpg\" srcset=\"hot_reload/img/science-1140.jpg 1140w,hot_reload/img/science-768.jpg 768w,hot_reload/img/science-576.jpg 576w,hot_reload/img/science-319.jpg 319w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575.8px) 100vw,(max-width: 991.8px) 540px,(max-width: 1199.8px) 720px,855px\">\n    </picture>\n  </noscript>\n</p>\n\n<p>Traditional Software Engineering makes use of the waterfall model:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Requirements study</strong>: talk to the client and stakeholders to draw and agree requirements, to limit the scope of the system.</li>\n  <li><strong>Designs</strong>: produce designs of the system, such as UML, use cases, and come up with a few early prototypes. This will guide your development process and help to communicate with the client.</li>\n  <li><strong>Implementation</strong>: get on with building the system, spawning dev/staging environments and deploying code as it comes.</li>\n  <li><strong>Testing</strong>: today we usually write tests during implementation, and even tend to utilise TDD. But every developer will know that tests can be sloppy when we were in the flow of programming and didn't bother to add tests. At this stage, we can pull up our test coverage so that our software product is of acceptable quality. More integration and manual testing is also done here.</li>\n  <li><strong>Evaluation</strong>: deploy staging and let stakeholders use it. Speak to them, to see if the built solution matches the agreed requirements.</li>\n  <li><strong>Delivery & Maintenance</strong>: software is deployed to production and handed over to the client. Most often than not, the same development company will maintain it. Plan for next versions from the points raised in evaluation.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Today, we mostly hear about \"agile\" and \"iterative process\", but traditional approach is more conservative and allows to prevent scope creeping. We focus on the RESULT that we want to achieve with our system &mdash; whereas within this main process, we can apply agile for implementation.</p>\n\n<!-- There's absolutely no respect left online for proper scientists. Probably only around 1% of people who call themselves Software Engineers, even having a Computer Science degree, take scientific approach. Others think they're here to code, and programming is the most important thing. Software engineering is so much more than that. You need to understand your problem, draw requirements, create designs, implement them, test functionally and against business goals, and maintain. Our culture has degenerated completely and people don't even know what culture is: they think they make a popular package, so they must be really good.  -->\n\n<h3 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h3>\n\n<p>Understanding the problem</p>",
